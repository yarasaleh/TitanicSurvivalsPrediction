# TitanicSurvivalsPrediction
ML classification model <br>

MADE FOR LEARNING PURPOSES.<br>

This was made for kaggle challenge : [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)<br>
Programming is all about "borrowing" code, because knife sharpens knife. 
Thanks to [this kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/ldfreeman3/a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy) I was able to experiment with his code and understand some ML and Data Science .<br>
